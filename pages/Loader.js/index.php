		<p>One of the things I've done with this new site is the usage of jQuery. You may notice all pages on this website load from the index (www.mspry.net), and if you look at the url I've also added in page links using the hash symbol like this one (www.mspry.net/#Loader.js). This is done with jQuery, below I have linked to my bitbucket repository where the source has been posted.</p>
