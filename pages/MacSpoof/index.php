		<br>
				<br>
				<p>
				This is a AppleScript I've been working on, its purpose is to make changing Mac Addresses on OS X easier. It works by running the built in terminal commands for changing Mac Addresses, all you need to do is choose Mac Address you would like to spoof to. This is just a hobby for me and is supplied 100% free, as far as I'm concerned the script is finished now. I may add more to it at a later point in time but for now its tested from 10.7 Lion all the way up to the latest 10.9 Mavericks and I doubt it will break any time soon unless Apple decides to rework terminal commands.</p>
