# Loader.js
# This is the plugin I wrote to manage pages on my website (mspry.net)

# I'm putting it here for a few reasons, one so anyone can look over and/or learn from it and because Bootcamp broke my OS X partition resulting in losing everything, luckily I was able to pull it from my web server and will be keeping it on my bitbucket from now on for safe keeping.
